### Rogan Guest Stats Notebook

Download, scrape, compile and view various data about the many guests that Joe Rogan has had on his show.

The notebook contains many different data insights through the pandas data module. Simply run the appropriate cells to collect and load data, then see which facts and statistics tickle your fancy. Modify and expand if you want.

**_Requirements_**: Needs my CNW Scraper module which can be found [here](https://github.com/cwylycode/CNW_Scraper). Other modules needed are listed inside the notebook as imports.

**_Fun Fact_**: I'm not even a fan of Joe Rogan or anything. Never listened to a single one of his podcasts. I only made this because it was good experience for collection and scraping of web data and because some guy on reddit said it would be interesting to see what kind of data any of his guests would have. Thought it was a neat idea.
